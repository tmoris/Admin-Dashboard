## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
-scss- 



### What I learned

While working on this project i have learnt
how to:- use CSS grid for styling page  and create reponsive layouts.
I have also learnt;  how organize work using scss partial files,  use of mixins and accessing of scss variables using @use


For code snippets examples, see below:

```css -grid
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: " navigationbar site-header"
    " navigationbar main-content"
    " navigationbar  main-content"
    " navigationbar  main-content"
    "  footer footer";
}
